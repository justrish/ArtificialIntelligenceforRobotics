# Parent Repository: Computer Vision
Consists of multiple source code or projects developed or currently working in the application areas of Computer Vision
* Semantic Segmentation:  
I tested and evaluated SegNet architecture for autonomous driving. Give a closer outlook at pros and cons list of training , datasets used, architecures designed and trained models available. I closely inspect the inference time and accuracy of of the models and they plays a signifciant role for the problem of Autonomous driving . The results and observations gathered are compiled together in the report and presentation .
* ArtificialIntelligenceforRobotics :
This repository will demonstrate my knowledge and skills for SLAM learned from the course Artificial Intelligence for Robotics (Udacity)
